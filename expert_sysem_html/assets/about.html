						<h1>The Project</h1>
						<p>Do you know something where others come to you for your knowledge? 
						Perhaps you are an auto mechanic who has built a repertoire of knowledge
						for diagnosing vehicle issues.  Maybe people come to you for troubleshooting 
						technology issues in the office. Whatever you are an expert with, you can build
						a system to help others access your expertise!</p>
						</br>
						<p>Our Expert System Builder lets you create a system which will help users query
						your knowledge in a very simple, intutitive way.  As an expert you can guide users
						with custom text prompts, possible diagnoses, and explanations. Our system allows
						you to control the flow of a body of knowledge so it is simply presented to a user
						without any programming required!  Simply create rules and actions and decide what
						you want your system to determine.  You can download the free to use tool or run it
						online anytime.  If you need help using the system you can always look at our
						documentation and examples to figure out how you want to capture your expert knowledge.<p>

						<h1>Our Mission</h1>
						<p>Over the last 30+ years a variety of different attempts have been made to create Expert Systems. 
						Many of these programs require the user to learn a great deal to even begin creating an expert system.  
						These systems also have cumbersome input techniques which make creating an expert system very frustrating.  
						Our mission is to allow the easy creation of an expert system by users with minimal knowledge on expert systems. 
						Using graphical interfaces and a design which allows easy verification and testing while creating the system,
						our design makes creating an expert system so much easier.  We want to take advantage of the jump in computer 
						processing power to reimagine tried expert system techniques to make them possible and accessible on any computer for any user.</p>
